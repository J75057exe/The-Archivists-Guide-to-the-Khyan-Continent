        <description>
            <p>A witch's familiar is no ordinary pet. Some say that a witch's familiar holds the soul of an undead, making them smarter than average familiars and often give them some semblance of autonomy and personality. Whilst remaining completely and unerringly loyal, in certain moments the familiar can exhibit conscientiousness. Witches make an eternal bond with their familiar, forming a pact. As a player it is up to you to decide the personality of your familiar as you are the one who made a pact with the spirit. Often a witch's familiar has few qualms with being a familiar and submits to being a servant. Because your familiar has a soul and will, it can act independently of you while you're incapacitated but only performing something it truly believes to be in your best wishes, as are the terms of the pact, no exceptions, or else the soul shall be eternally damned to the deepest layers of the nine hells.</p>
            <p class="indent">Starting from level 2 you gain a magical familiar. You learn the spell Find Familiar, however, it’s intelligence score (if not higher) is 11. The familiar can communicate its thoughts to you via your telepathic link, and while your familiar is in a form with an associated language, you learn that language. Your coven allows an alternate form for your familiar:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><i><b>Coven of the Oracle</b></i> Gazer</li>
                <li><i><b>Coven of the Cadaver</b></i> Shadow</li>
                <li><i><b>Coven of the Lunatic</b></i> Faerie Dragon</li>
            </ul>

        <description>
            <p>As a witch, you learn hexes and curses that you can subject others to. At level 6 you learn two from the standard list. Hexes can be used once per long rest and only have verbal components and a range of 90ft. Hexes can be ended prematurely through use of a greater restoration spell, remove curse spell, or other similar magic. They force the target to make a wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC. You learn another hex at levels 14, and 18.</p>

        <description>
            <p>At level 14, your familiar gains the ability to assume a more powerful form to serve as your protector. This form is not added to the list of available familiar forms. It remains under your control and all the rules for a familiar apply however it can now attack in this form, including using its different types of ray if a Spectator. Transforming into its alternate form uses the familiar's action and it can remain in this form for up to 10 minutes, after which you must finish a long rest before being able to be used again, or perform the ritual for Find Familiar again.</p>

            <p>For the next 24 hours, the target loses fine motor function in their fingers. The target cannot do things such as tie knots, playing an instrument, or sewing and spellcasters can longer cast spells with somatic components. This effect can be overcome with a Dexterity (sleight of hand) check against your spell save DC. This does not end the curse, but temporarily overrides it.</p>

            <p>For the next 24 hours, if the target moves too fast they start to feel dizzy and disoriented. Whenever the target moves more than half their movement speed in a round they must make a Dexterity saving throw against your spell save DC. If they fail they fall prone. When this happens target must succeed on a DC10 constitution saving throw. If they fail they vomit on the ground in front of them.</p>
