            <p>When you take this oath at 3rd level, you gain the following two Channel Divinity options.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>Calling of the Void. </i></b>You submit a being to the elder god you serve. You target a creature within 30ft. They must succeed on a charisma saving throw or else be banished until the end of their next turn. When they return they are stunned until the beginning of their next turn. If you hit the creature while it is stunned from this effect the attack deals an extra 2d8 damage. Creatures that are immune to fear or are native to the abyss are not stunned by this effect.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>Turn the Usurpers. </i></b>As an action, you present your holy symbol and speak a condemnation, wreaking the minds of celestials and undead, using your Channel Divinity. Each celestial or undead that can see or hear you within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw. If the creature fails its saving throw, it is turned for 1 minute or until it takes damage.</p>
            <p class="indent">A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can’t willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you. It also can’t take reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If there’s nowhere to move, the creature can use the Dodge action.</p>
